Site Type: FARM
Description: Paragominas soybean farm
Location: -3.00°S, -47.35°W
Expected Transition Year: 2005

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peak Deforestation Year: 2001

SUMMARY:
================================================================================

This site shows how deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been linked
to economic development through agricultural production.

As a farm site, this area demonstrates:
- Conversion of forest to crop cultivation
- Changes in vegetation productivity (NDVI)
- Economic activity indicators (nighttime lights)

Annual snapshots and time series plots provide visual evidence of
the transformation and its economic consequences.
