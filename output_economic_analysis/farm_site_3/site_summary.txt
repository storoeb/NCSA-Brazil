Site Type: FARM
Description: Lucas do Rio Verde crop farm
Location: -13.05°S, -55.90°W
Expected Transition Year: 2006

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:
================================================================================

This site shows how deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been linked
to economic development through agricultural production.

As a farm site, this area demonstrates:
- Conversion of forest to crop cultivation
- Changes in vegetation productivity (NDVI)
- Economic activity indicators (nighttime lights)

Annual snapshots and time series plots provide visual evidence of
the transformation and its economic consequences.
